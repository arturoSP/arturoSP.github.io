### Maíces Nativos en México y en la Región Otomí Tepehua

Web apps developed to showcase the diversity and importance of native corn.

[**Maíces Nativos en México**](https://arturosp.shinyapps.io/MaizNativo/) was developed as an educational app that shows the results of the [Proyecto Global de Maíces of CONABIO](https://www.biodiversidad.gob.mx/diversidad/proyectoMaices) in an orderly, easy to understand manner, to help people see and learn about how corn is as diverse as it is vital for Mexican culture and food. 

[**Maíces Nativos en la Región Otomí-Tepehua**](https://alinerona2022.shinyapps.io/MaizOtomiTepehua/) was made to showcase the results of a similar survey made in the Otomí-Tepehua region, as part of the postdoctoral proyect of Dra. Aline Romero-Natale to explore the corn diversity in the region.

### Salud Ambiental en la Cuenca del Alto Atoyac

Book series that address the critical health situation of people living around the Atoyac, one of the most polluted rivers in Mexico.

This book is the result of a two-year program funded by CONAHCYT to make research in health issues, based on data science. My participation involved obtaining, managing, summarising and analysing large volumes of data in order to gain insights of the effects of pollution to people's health.
