### \* Data science based environmental research

Experienced environmental sciences researcher and data scientist. I mainly work with R but also have experience with GIS software.

When not coding on a project, I might be in a meeting. Otherwise, I enjoy playing videogames, reading science fiction and cycling in the city.

## Currently working on

I am working on the development of a protocol to help in the planning phase of ecological surveys by optimizing the sampling effort through calculations based on pilot studies. 

This tool is being funded by a postdoctoral grant by CONAHCYT and hosted by the ENES Mérida.
